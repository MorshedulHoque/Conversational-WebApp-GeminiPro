# Gemini LLM Q&A Application

## Project Overview
This project utilizes the powerful Gemini language model from Google's generative AI suite to create a Q&A application. Integrated with Streamlit, the app offers a user-friendly interface where users can pose questions and receive responses generated by the Gemini model.

## Features

| Feature               | Description                                                         |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Environment Variables | Securely load necessary credentials using `dotenv`.                 |
| Streamlit Interface   | A sleek, web-based interface for users to interact with the model.  |
| Gemini Pro Model      | Leverage the advanced capabilities of the Gemini Pro model.         |
| Real-time Interaction | Users can input questions and get immediate responses.              |

## How It Works
1. **Setup Environment**: Utilizes Python's `dotenv` package to manage environment variables securely.
2. **Streamlit Application**: The app is built with Streamlit, providing an interactive interface for users.
3. **Gemini Model Integration**: Integrates Google's Gemini Pro model to generate accurate and contextually relevant answers.
